# FlaskAttempt
Small Flask site that has data visualization.


This was initially me just trying out Flask as opposed to Django but since then I also wanted to see how to integrate a python script into
a website. This resulted in me grabbing stock data, parsing through it with Pandas and then creating a graph with bokeh. After creating
a script that could create a graph using stock data that gets pulled from the web, I tried injecting it into an HTML page. The graph
is responsive and can be updated to work dynamically (IE. it can always grab data up until the latest date available.)
